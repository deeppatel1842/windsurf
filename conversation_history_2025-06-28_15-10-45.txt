Initial Issue:
- Error loading LLM: Request failed: HTTP 404 Not Found

Changes Made:
1. Updated MODEL_NAME to "orca-mini-3b-gguf2-q4_0.ggml"
2. Modified load_llm() to try multiple models
3. Added error handling for model loading
4. Reorganized imports for better readability

Current Status:
- The script attempts to load available models
- Tries multiple known working models
- Provides detailed error messages
- Falls back to downloading a default model if none work

Next Steps:
1. Check available models with GPT4All.list_models()
2. Try manually downloading a model
3. Consider alternative approaches if needed
